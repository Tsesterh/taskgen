Python Code: import datetime

# Define the initial date
initial_date = datetime.datetime(1997, 8, 3)

# Subtract 10 days
new_date = initial_date - datetime.timedelta(days=10)

# Print the new date in MM/DD/YYYY format
print(new_date.strftime("%m/%d/%Y"))


New Experiment:
Instruction: Context: Today is Sep 9, 1909. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?
Previous Subtasks: {}
Instruction: Add one day to September 9, 1909, and format the result in MM/DD/YYYY.
Output: 09/10/1909

Python Code: import datetime

today = datetime.datetime(1909, 9, 9)
tomorrow = today + datetime.timedelta(days=1)
print(tomorrow.strftime("%m/%d/%Y"))
